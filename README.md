# speech-emotion-recognition
 
This repo is based on the paper Giuseppe de Pinto et all (GitHub repo : https://github.com/marcogdepinto/emotion-classification-from-audio-files). The aim is to compare different acoustic features and evaluate their performance for Speech emotion recognition task (SER). There are two notebooks present in the repo:

1) Comparining SER with different acoustic features (In progress): This notebook houses the code and experimental results of performing the SER task using the following acoustic features.
* Mel spectogram
* Mel spectogram and pitch
* MFCC 
* MFCC and pitch
* Geneva extended minimilastic parameter set (GeMAPS)
* MFCC and GeMAPS
* Mel Spectogram and GeMAPS

2) Speech Emotion Recognition: This notebook houses the code for running the speech emotion recognition task.
